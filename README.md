Vectorizing and expanding the 2006-style NTT DoCoMo emoji set. According to [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/docomo/2006), this particular set was developed from 2006 to 2008. A 2008 [emoji conversion table](https://web.archive.org/web/20090117122111/http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/binary/pdf/service/mail/imode_mail/function/emoji_convert/pictogram.pdf) from DoCoMo lists 210 emojis from this set.

## How to contribute

You can help by submitting SVG versions of the 210 emojis we still don't have vectors for, or by designing new ones for emojis that didn't exist in the 2006 set. SVGs must be 12x12 px and can be either black or colored (we'll generate a full B&W version later).

## Possible questions

### What is the current state of the project?

I'm currently vectorizing the existing 210 emojis.

### Why not expand the 2013 set?

I prefer the pixel art style. The 2013 set will definitely be used as a reference, as it has many emojis that aren't in the 2006 set.

### What is the goal of the project?

The goal is to have a modern, complete emoji font based on the NTT DoCoMo emoji set from 2006.
